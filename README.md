# resistor-tag-audio-prototype
A prototype for my second year engineering design course. The objective of this design was to assist visually impaired individuals with clothing detection. This design utlizes an Arudino Micro to read resistance values of various resistors that serve as clothing tags. The resistance values are detected and sent over the serial port to a Windows Form developed in Visual Studio C#. If a new resistor value is recieved, the user is prompted to record an audio clip that describes the clothing article. If a previously detected resistor is detected, the existing audio file is played back.
